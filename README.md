# Deep-Learning-EEG-Analysis
This project aims to create an interface for practitionners to analyze and make AI-informed decisions. I was part of team of 7, where two of us, including me, implemented the object-oriented interface while three others focused on the AI pattern recognition algorithm and the remaining two on project management, data retrieval and code validation.

**I only included the work on the interface, as it is the area I contributed to in the greatest deal.**
